# Node.js with TypeScript

[SUBJECT.md for the instructions](./SUBJECT.md)

# GSE work

I'm always doing TDD, in order to avoid wasting my time with PostMan and manual testing.


For that, I've added 2 libs
npm i mocha --save
npm i isomorphic-fetch --save

and one script:  npm run test

One test as example has been written and passed, so that my tests infrastrucre is ok, and can be added to a CI pipeline.
